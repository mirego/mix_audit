  <code>MixAudit</code> provides a <code>mix deps.audit</code> task to scan Mix dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
  <br />
  It draw its inspiration from tools like <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit"><code>npm audit</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit"><code>bundler-audit</code></a>.

## Installation

### Project dependency

Add `mix_audit` to the `deps` function in your project’s `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:mix_audit, "~> 2.0", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix do deps.get, deps.compile` inside your project’s directory.

### Local `escript`

If you do not wish to include `mix_audit` in your project dependencies, you can install it as global `escript`:

```bash
$ mix escript.install hex mix_audit
…
* creating …/.mix/escripts/mix_audit
```

The only difference is that instead of using the `mix deps.audit` task, you will have to use the created executable.

## Usage

To generate a security report, you can use the `deps.audit` Mix task:

```bash
$ mix deps.audit
```

### Options

| Option                   | Type   | Default             | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--path`                 | String | _Current directory_ | The root path of the project to audit                        |
| `--format`               | String | `"human"`           | The format of the report to generate (`"json"` or `"human"`) |
| `--ignore-advisory-ids`  | String | `""`                | Comma-separated list of advisory IDs to ignore               |
| `--ignore-package-names` | String | `""`                | Comma-separated list of package names to ignore              |

## How does it work?

MixAudit builds two lists when it’s executed in a project:

1. A list of security advisories fetched from the GitHub-sourced [`elixir-security-advisories`](https://github.com/mirego/elixir-security-advisories) repository
2. A list of Mix dependencies from the various `mix.lock` files in the project

Then, it loops through each project dependency and tries to find security advisories that apply to it (through its package name) and that match its version specification (through the advisory vulnerable version ranges).

If one is found, a **vulnerability** (the combination of a **security advisory** and a **project dependency**) is then added to the report.

The task will exit with a `0` status only if the report _passes_ (ie. it reports no vulnerabilities). Otherwise, it will exit with a `1` status.

## `mix deps.audit` vs. `mix hex.audit`

Mix provides a [`mix hex.audit` task](https://hexdocs.pm/hex/Mix.Tasks.Hex.Audit.html). According to its documentation, `mix hex.audit` shows all dependencies that have been marked as retired.

MixAudit provides a `mix deps.audit` task (similar to [`npm audit`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) and [`bundler-audit`](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit)) that scans dependencies for [reported security vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mirego/elixir-security-advisories).

Both tasks are useful but they just don’t share the same purpose.
